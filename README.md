I forgot the Description Etiquette. But names are self-explanatory, name-calling is the highest form of acknowledgement, and I hold that word to the highest regard, so expect a ramble like this is my kid. But don't worry, I take insults as un-immediate criticism, &amp; can process anything into my greater whole :)
